Install Foundry as a Progressive Web App with its own shortcut and window.

Have you ever wanted your players to have their own app for Foundry VTT? Perhaps they get distracted otherwise or perhaps you just like how cool it looks. I even recommend using this if you are a gamemaster that always has their browser open anyway, since it will be less taxing on your computer's resources!
